# Implementing CardLayout in Windows Forms

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create a stack-based card layout that displays one card (control) at a time
- Build wizard-style interfaces with sequential card navigation
- Implement property pages with card switching
- Organize multiple panels or controls as cards within a container
- Navigate programmatically between different views or screens

## Component Overview

`CardLayout` is a layout manager that organizes controls in a stack-of-cards appearance. Each control added to the layout becomes a "card," and only one card is visible at a time. The container acts as a stack of cards, with the first component added being initially visible. Cards can be configured with custom names, images, and sizing behavior.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Set unique names for each card
- Navigate between cards (First, Next, Previous, Last)
- Configure layout modes (Default or Fill)
- Maintain aspect ratio for child controls
- Get/set selected card by name or index

## Documentation and Navigation Guide

### Card Navigation
📄 **Read:** [references/card-navigation.md](references/card-navigation.md)
- Selecting cards by name using SelectedCard property
- Navigation methods: First(), Next(), Previous(), Last()

## Quick Start Example

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Windows.Forms.Tools;
using System.Windows.Forms;

public class CardLayoutForm : Form
{
    private CardLayout cardLayout1;
    private Panel cardLayoutPanel;
    private Panel card1;
    private Panel card2;

    public CardLayoutForm()
    {
        // Initialize CardLayout
        cardLayout1 = new CardLayout();
        cardLayoutPanel = new Panel();
        cardLayoutPanel.BackColor = Color.White;
        cardLayoutPanel.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;

        // Set container
        cardLayout1.ContainerControl = cardLayoutPanel;

        // Create cards (panels)
        card1 = new Panel();
        card1.BackColor = Color.LightBlue;
        card1.Controls.Add(new Label { Text = "Card 1", AutoSize = true });

        card2 = new Panel();
        card2.BackColor = Color.LightGreen;
        card2.Controls.Add(new Label { Text = "Card 2", AutoSize = true });

        // Add cards to the main panel
        cardLayoutPanel.Controls.Add(card1);
        cardLayoutPanel.Controls.Add(card2);

        // Set card names
        cardLayout1.SetCardName(card1, "FirstCard");
        cardLayout1.SetCardName(card2, "SecondCard");

        // Navigate between cards
        cardLayout1.SelectedCard = "FirstCard";
        cardLayout1.Next(); // Display SecondCard

        // Add to form
        this.Controls.Add(cardLayoutPanel);
    }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Wizard Interface
Create sequential steps where users navigate forward/backward through cards:
```csharp
private void NextButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.cardLayout1.Next();
}

private void PreviousButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.cardLayout1.Previous();
}
```

### Pattern 2: Dropdown Card Selection
Allow users to select cards from a dropdown list:
```csharp
private void CardSelectionComboBox_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    string selectedCardName = CardSelectionComboBox.SelectedItem.ToString();
    this.cardLayout1.SelectedCard = selectedCardName;
}
```

### Pattern 3: Fill Container
Make cards stretch to fill the entire container:
```csharp
this.cardLayout1.LayoutMode = CardLayoutMode.Fill;
```
